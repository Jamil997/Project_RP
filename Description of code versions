# Project_RP
11/11/2023 the first trial to launch a code via MatLAb(unsuccesful)
file r_m(1) contains a code generating random matrices
file named "solution of r_m(1)_failed" shows an unsuccesful trial to find an optimal solution. 
"1st_success.m" is the first successful trial. 
solution "original problem" is the solution to the original LP problem, without applying random projections method.
